# Rock-Paper-Scissor-Game
A **Rock-Paper-Scissors game** in Python allows a player to choose rock, paper, or scissors against the computer, which makes a random choice. The game determines the winner based on standard rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock. It can be implemented using the random module and a simple loop for repeated play.ðŸŽ®
